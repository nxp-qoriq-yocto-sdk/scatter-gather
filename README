ARM's Trace Memory Controller can use tables in memory to find the addresses
of pages of memory to use for trace storage. All pages are 4KB and each is
referenced by a single entry in the tables. The tables form a linked list,
to ensure that the tables themselves are not required to be larger than 4KB.

These tables are called 'scatter-gather tables'. The entries are always 32-bit:

Bits	Description

[31:4]	Bits [39:12] of an address. Bits [11:0] are always zero.
	The meaning of this field is dependent on the entry type.
[3:2]	Reserved.
[1:0]	Entry type:

	00 Reserved.
	01 Last. The address points to a 4KB page to use for buffer storage
	   and this is the last entry in the tables.
	10 Normal. The address points to a 4KB page to use for buffer storage
	   and the next entry in the table is valid. The entry must not be
	   the last entry in a 4KB page.
	11 Link. The address points to the base of a further 4KB page of table
	   entries.

The module implements the whole scatter-gather logic for multiple tables and
keeps track of them with a linked list.
